## Weather-by-Latitude


#Overview
Python script to visualize weather of 500 unique cities across the world in selected random locations using Citipy Python package. Citipy randomly selects non-repeated cities based on latitude and longitude. OpenWeatherMap API called for current weather statistics in selected cities.

#Scatter plots demonstrate the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude.
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude.
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude.
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.


Print log of city number, city name, and requested URL as cities are processed.
CSV of all data retrieved and scatter plot png images.

#Observations:

1. Temperature increases as location approaches the equator at 0 latitude.

2. Humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed do not show a relationship to latitude.
